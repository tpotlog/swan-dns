# swan-dns

Swan DNS is a python based DNS server taking the concept of plug-ins to the next level.
The entire idea is to create a DNS server where writing a costume DNS resolver is not more than writing a simple small plug-in.

More than this plug-ins can be reused and concatenate together to provide a simple way for a very complex to achive DNS resolution
with commonly used dns servers/tools.
