# swan-dns

Swan DNS is a python based DNS server taking the concept of plug-ins to the next level.

The entire idea is to create a DNS server where writing a costume DNS resolver is not more than a simple small plug-in.
More than this plug-ins could be reused and concatenate together to provide a simple to very complex to achive DNS response
which can be a really hard task with common used dns servers.
